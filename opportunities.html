            <p class="intro_content" style = "font-size: 22px"; > A good team is made of strong players. The Developmental Intelligence Lab is always seeking to 
			     recruit young players who are highly motivated to work hard to reach to the next level. 
				 Contemporary science is increasingly interdisciplinary. Future scholars need to be trained to not only be an expert of a specific field 
				 but also be knowledgeable about multiple disparate fields. 
				 The Developmental Intelligence Lab has been an intellectual home for postdoc fellows, graduate and undergraduate students with different backgrounds, 
				 including psychology, cognitive science, computer science, data science and speech and hearing sciences.
				 The lab culture encourages members coming from different fields to learn from each other, and to develop a deep understanding 
				 and an appreciation of multiple scientific fields. In our lab meetings, for example, we may discuss a paper on how children learn language 
				 one week, followed by a paper on deep neural networks for visual object recognition the week after. 
				 <!--Our research work aims at connecting and bridging recent research ideas and findings emerging from behavioral science, neuroscience and computer science. 
				 -->
				 Learning to take different perspectives will help trainees to broaden their horizons, think “big” and "deep", and learn needed technical skills to  
				 be better prepared as an all-around scientist.
				  <br><br> If you are interested in joining the team, please reach out to Dr. Chen Yu
                (chenyu@austin.utexas.edu) or <a href="team.html" > current lab members</a> to learn more about the team.

                <p>Our graduate students excel in research on developmental learning and cognition, typical and atypical development,
                    modeling, and computer vision. Students gain skills in advanced computational techniques and
                    state-of-the-art research technology.  </p> <p>Dr. Chen Yu’s graduate students are typically completing PhDs in Developmental Psychology and Cognitive Science. 
					Meanwhile, our research work is highly interdiciplinary, aiming at bridging human learning and machine learning.
					<strong>Students in other areas, such as computer science, data science, speech and hearing sciences</strong>, are encouraged to reach out expressing interest.
                    Multiple academic pathways lead to a successful graduate career and the collaborative nature of UT
                    Austin permits many of our students to be co-mentored with professors across different areas and
                    departments.  </p> <p>Interested students are encouraged to explore <a href="pub.html" > our recent work </a>, and talk to <a href="team.html" > our current lab members</a>
					about their research and experiences in the lab,
                    as well as directly contact Dr. Chen Yu.</p>

                    assistants work closely with a graduate student or post-doc in the lab, help with behavioral coding
                    (like transcribing speech or categorizing child reaches), attend lab meetings, read and discuss
                    papers with their mentor, and even collect data when participants visit the lab.  </p> <p> If you have
                    questions about working in the lab or want to learn more, feel free to reach out to any of <a href="team.html" > our current lab members</a>
					or Dr. Chen Yu. We accept applications throughout the year and will
                    conduct interviews when there is an open position. </p> <p> To apply, please complete <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kII1DQz6188G1XagvT6ZY6jhlg9RFja-ob9p_rEurjk/edit?usp=sharing"> our RA application form</a> and
                    return it to us, along with your transcript and resume, following the directions on the form.
                    Selected students must enroll in course credits.</p>
